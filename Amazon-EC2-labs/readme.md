# AWS EC2 Labs 
Welcome to my EC2 Repository on GitHub! ðŸ’» 
Dive into a collection of projects focused on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, where I demonstrate my expertise in deploying, managing, and optimizing virtual servers in the AWS cloud. 
Explore projects ranging from basic instance provisioning and configuration to advanced topics such as auto-scaling groups, spot instances, and instance metadata. Whether you're interested in understanding EC2 instance types, exploring custom Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), or implementing high availability architectures, this repository offers a wealth of knowledge and practical insights. 
Join me as we harness the power of EC2 to build scalable, reliable, and cost-effective solutions in the cloud!
